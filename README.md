# Shakespearan-Insult-Generator
Randomly generate Shakespeare insult.

Everyone knows Shakespeare and his bizarre language. Well, I contemplated a view of his frequently used words to verbally
abuse someone and thought, "Why not create a generator to spontaneously create insults?" So, I did. All code is thought of and
written by me. I copied no one, nor was I inspired by anyone. This I made as I learned java, and thus, it is not that advanced.
A very basic program in fact. If you want to try it out, just click download and click run in your IDE. I'm currently try to
learn how to put it on a website.

Thanks for giving some of your time to look at my program!
